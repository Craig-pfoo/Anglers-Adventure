      <h2>Lures & Bait</h2>
      <p>
        When you first go to a place to look for lures and bait it can be very
        overwhelming. There are so many choices even when just looking for the
        most basic supplies. This should help with the bare minimum for fishing.
      </p>
      <h5>Natural + Artifical Bait</h5>
      <p></p>
      <h5>CrankBait</h5>
      <p>
        These are hard plastic lures that are usually made to mimic a baitfish.
        They are used primarily to trigger the fish's natural predatory
        instincs, these can be used effectivly to sink, float, or hover on the
        water.
      </p>
      <h5>Spinnerbait</h5>
      <p>
        A spinnerbait is a popular fishing lure designed to mimic the movement
        of injured baitfish. It typically consists of a metal wire frame with
        one or more spinning metal blades attached to one end and a weighted
        body or jig head at the other. The blades create vibration and flash as
        they spin through the water, attracting predatory fish like bass, pike,
        and muskie. Spinnerbaits are versatile and can be used in various
        fishing conditions, from shallow to deep water, making them a favorite
        among anglers for both freshwater and saltwater fishing.
      </p>
      <h5>Spoons</h5>
      <p>
        A spoon bait, also known simply as a spoon, is a type of fishing lure
        characterized by its shape resembling a spoon. These lures typically
        consist of a concave, metallic, or reflective body with a single or
        multiple hooks attached. Spoon baits are designed to imitate the erratic
        movement of injured baitfish or other prey, making them highly
        attractive to predatory fish. When retrieved, spoon baits flutter and
        wobble through the water, creating flash and vibration that entices fish
        to strike. They are versatile lures suitable for various fishing
        techniques, including casting, trolling, and jigging, and are effective
        for targeting a wide range of species, including trout, salmon, bass,
        and pike.
      </p>
      <h5>Jigs</h5>
      <p>
        Jigs are versatile fishing lures consisting of a weighted head usually
        made of lead or tungsten, with one or more hooks attached. The head may
        be molded into various shapes, often resembling a minnow, crawfish, or
        other natural prey. Jigs can be dressed with various materials such as
        feathers, fur, rubber, or soft plastic to enhance their appearance and
        action in the water.
      </p>
      <h5>Flies</h5>
      <p>
        Different flies for fishing are specialized artificial lures designed to
        mimic various aquatic insects, baitfish, crustaceans, or other natural
        prey species that fish feed on. These flies are primarily used in fly
        fishing, a distinct angling method that involves casting a lightweight
        fly line combined with a specialized fly rod and reel.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Dry Flies</strong>: These flies are designed to float on the
        water's surface to imitate adult insects, such as mayflies, caddisflies,
        or stoneflies. They are typically constructed with buoyant materials
        like feathers, hair, or foam and are used when fish are feeding on
        insects at or near the water's surface.
        <br />
        <strong>Wet Flies</strong>: Unlike dry flies, wet flies are designed to
        sink below the water's surface. They represent various life stages of
        aquatic insects, such as nymphs, emergers, or drowned insects. Wet flies
        are often fished with a slow retrieve or allowed to drift in the current
        to mimic the natural movement of underwater insects.
        <br />
        <strong>Nymphs</strong>: Nymphs are imitation larvae or immature stages
        of aquatic insects that inhabit the stream bottom. They are weighted to
        sink and are typically fished near the riverbed to imitate the natural
        behavior of these insects as they drift with the current.
