    <h2>Rods</h2>
    <h3>Spinning Rod</h3>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <p>
      Spinning rods are among the most popular types of fishing rods due to
      their versatility and ease of use. They feature a reel mounted on the
      underside of the rod, allowing for easy casting and retrieval. Spinning
      rods are suitable for various fishing techniques and can handle a wide
      range of fish species.

    <h3>BaitCasting Rod</h3>

    <p>
      Baitcasting rods are designed for more precise and controlled casting,
      making them ideal for targeting larger fish species. They feature a reel
      mounted on the top side of the rod and require some skill to master
      casting without backlash. Baitcasting rods often provide greater casting
      accuracy and sensitivity compared to spinning rods.

    <h3>Fly Rod</h3>

    <p>
      Fly rods are specifically designed for fly fishing, a technique where
      artificial flies are cast using a weighted line. They are typically longer
      and more flexible than other types of rods to allow for delicate
      presentations of the fly. Fly rods come in various weights and lengths,
      each suited to different types of fly fishing applications and target
      species.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Surf Rod</h3>

    <p>
      Surf rods are designed for fishing in saltwater environments from the
      shoreline or beach. They are typically longer and sturdier than other rods
      to enable long casts into the surf and to handle larger fish species
      commonly found in coastal waters. Surf rods often feature large guides and
      robust construction to withstand the rigors of casting heavy baits and
      battling strong currents.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Ice Fishing Rod</h3>

    <p>
      They are typically shorter than traditional rods and feature sensitive
      tips to detect subtle bites in cold water conditions. Ice fishing rods may
      come in specialized designs such as jigging rods or tip-up rods, each
      suited to different ice fishing techniques.
